  	``{
  "merchantId": "2a263ef2-13f2-4561-b05c-ebde41f08d13",
  "apiKey": "uBucbJJSyRhQ93hTdaSkm6M/cfSIWSbI1MD69fFkSWQ=",
  "enableOverCapture": false,
  "overCapturePercentage": 10
  }
``
  	
    d.) Note down the ``merchantId`` and ``apiKey``. They cannot be retrieved again.

3. Create a Merchant Account Group in the open payment framework workbench. Refer to [Create Merchant Account](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_CLOUD_PUBLIC_CLOUD/0996ba68e5794b8ab51db8d25d4c9f8a/20a64f954df1425391757759011e7e6b.html)  for detailed instructions.

   b.) In the **General configuration** tab, set the Merchant ID of the Payment account to be the value which retrieved in step 2.

   c.) In the **Notification** tab, note down the URL for notification.
   
6. Edit the Postman Collection in the Postman app.

   a.) Import the two files at the same time to Postman.

   b.) Make sure to select the environment for Mock Gateway.

   c.) Edit the Postman environment file so the collection can be imported with all your OPF Tenant and Mock Gateway Test Account unique values.
